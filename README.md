# Calculator
A calculator app that allows you to perform arithmetic operations.
Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation can be performed.
The calculator also works for decimal and negative numbers.

The calculator can be launched by running the index.html file in a browser.

If the screen displays "Error" or "Infinity", you MUST press the Clear button before you can enter your next calculation.

This calculator also implements answer carry-over, which means for example, if you press the buttons "3+3 =" and get 6, you can then directly press "+ 3 =" and you get 9.

To do exponentiation, press the multiplication button twice (just as Javascript carries out exponentiation through **). For instance, if you press "3 xx 3 =", the calculator will display 3^3 and you get 27.
